<h1>About me</h1>


<div id="Looks">
<p> Comming from my first year of highschool. I had to manage my academic life with my personal life. 
   And as you're all aware can be a difficult task at times. All Star Code really did add an extra 
   layer of high expectations and set the bar high. So i'm proud to have this website up and running.</p>

<div id="MyBackground"> 
<p> I am from Bronx, New York and I got introduced to this program in 2022 after hearing 
   about it from another program I was in. I was always good with math and wanted to try 
   my hand in coding.</p>

<div id="MyBackground"> 
<p> Learning all of these new types of coding languages is really useful and so universal 
   for many types of projects. I first learned JavaScript, which is behind the functionality 
   of a website. It can <a href="#" target="_blank"> a</a>lso be used to make games.
      also be used to make games.
   </div>

<div id="MyBackground"> 
<p> After learning JavaScript, I then learned HTML.  
   HTML provides the most basic but important information to a website. 
   Next, I learned CSS, which makes websites visually appealings.</p>
