    My hobbies are closely tied with my interests. I like playing many different types of games and watch a lot of Youtube videos.

    I enjoy doing physical activities like going to the gym or simply running for the fun of it. Not much else can be said.

    From time to time, I play some board games with my family. Sometimes we play chess, other times we play uno or even uno triple. It's hard to remember all the different types of games we've played so far. But they were honestly pretty fun.
