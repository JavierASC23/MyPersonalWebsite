<div class="Topic_Discriptions">
<p id= "Sports_Discription"> I like playing all different types of sports. My favorite sports are football, soccer, volleyball. I find a great pleasure and enjoyment in playing in physical activities where you run alot and can play off of other people.</p>
<p id= "Chess_Discription"> The world of chess is fascinating and competitive. What makes chess to enjoyable to me is that when you win, you can see where your opponent went wrong and why you won. And when you lose, you can see where you went wrong. So theres always a learning opportunity which I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
<p id= "Roblox_Discription"> I am an avid gamer in many games. One game in particular is roblox. I know it's alittle childish to still be playing roblox in highschool, but there are few games that still manage to peek my interest. Playing games is a great way to take your mind off things and relax.</p>
<p id= "Family_Discription"> But most important of all, family. I truly do care a great amount about my family and have a good relationship with all of my family members. We also have a family dog, (pablo), pablo really has stayed with the family for years and hopefully for years to come. </p>
